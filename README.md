# unix.NET
A reimplementation of common Unix utilities in .NET

### Why?
I use Windows at work, and I find myself frequently in need of common Unix functionality. So instead 
of dedicating brain cells to learning the Windows way of doing things, I wrote my own utilities to 
accomplish the things I need.

These are command line functions that really complement PowerShell.
